lambda-packages
===============

|Build Status| |PyPI| |Slack|

Various popular libraries, pre-compiled to be compatible with AWS
Lambda.

Currently includes support for:

-  bcrypt
-  cffi
-  cryptography
-  LXML
-  misaka
-  MySQL-Python
-  numpy
-  OpenCV
-  Pillow (PIL)
-  psycopg2
-  PyCrypto
-  PyNaCl
-  pyproj

This project is intended for use by
`Zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa>`__, but could also be used by
any Python/Lambda project.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install lambda-packages

Usage
-----

The best way to use these packages is with
`Zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa>`__, which will automatically
install the right packages during deployment, and do a million other
useful things. Whatever you're currently trying to do on Lambda, it'll
be way easier for you if you just use Zappa right now. Trust me. It's
awesome. As a bonus, Zappa now also provides support for `manylinux
wheels <https://blog.zappa.io/posts/zappa-adds-support-for-manylinux-wheels>`__,
which adds support for hundreds of other packages.

But, if you want to use this project the other (wrong) way, just put the
contents of the .tar.gz archive into your lambda .zip.

**lambda-packages** also includes a manifest with information about the
included packages and the paths to their binaries.

.. code:: python

    from lambda_packages import lambda_packages

    print lambda_packages['psycopg2']['version']
    # 2.6.1
    print lambda_packages['psycopg2']['path']
    # /home/YourUsername/.venvs/lambda_packages/psycopg2/psycopg2-2.6.1.tar.gz

Contributing
------------

To add support for more packages, send a pull request containing a
gzipped tarball of the package (build on Amazon Linux and tested on AWS
Lambda) in the appropriate directory, an updated manifest, and
deterministic build instructions for creating the archive.

You may find the `build.sh
script <https://github.com/Miserlou/lambda-packages/blob/master/lambda_packages/cryptography/build.sh>`__
useful as a starting point.

Useful targets include:

-  MongoEngine
-  pandas
-  scipy
-  `scikit-learn <https://serverlesscode.com/post/deploy-scikitlearn-on-lamba/>`__
